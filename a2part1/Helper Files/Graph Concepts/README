Weekly Exercise 5: Graph Concepts

--------------
Included Files
--------------
    * graph_concepts.cpp
    * digraph.cpp
    * digraph.h
    * edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt
    * Makefile
    * README

----------------
Makefile Targets
----------------
    - make: generates an executable called 'graph_concepts'.
    - make graph_concepts: generates an executable called 'graph_concepts'.
    - make graph_concepts.o: generates an object file called 'graph_concepts.o'.
    - make digraph.o: generates an object file called 'digraph.o'.
    - make help: prints a list of executable and object targets.
	- make clean: removes all object files and executables.

---------------------
Running Instructions
---------------------
    1. To create the exercise4 executable, type 'make graph_concepts' or 'make'
    in the command-line.

    2. To create either the graph_concepts or digraph object file, type
    'make (object file).o' in the command-line, where (object file) is either
    graph_concepts or digraph.

    3. To remove all object files and executables, type 'make clean' in the
    command-line.

----------------------
Notes and Assumptions
----------------------
    * The program assumes that a command-line argument of the digraph .txt file
    is passed. I.e., after 'make graph_concepts', the user could type
    './graph_concepts edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt'.

    * If no command-line arguments are passed, the program will inform the user
    that there is no digraph text file provided, give the correct usage, and
    exit the program.

    * An example of a road network with 4 vertices and 3 edges is below (please
    see the assignment description for more details):

        V,1,53.430996,-113.491331
        V,2,53.434340,-113.490152
        V,3,53.414340,-113.470152
        V,4,53.435320,-113.480152
        E,1,3,St Albert Road
        E,2,3,80 Avenue North-west
        E,2,1,None

    * The Makefile will echo helpful messages to the user upon correct usage.
