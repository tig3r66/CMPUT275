Makefile Targets
----------------
    - make: generates an executable called 'server'.
    - make graph_concepts: generates an executable called 'server'.

    - make server.o: generates an object file called 'server.o'.
    - make dijkstra.o: generates an object file called 'dijkstra.o'.
    - make digraph.o: generates an object file called 'digraph.o'.

    - make help: prints a list of executable and object targets.
	- make clean: removes all object files and executables.

---------------------
Running Instructions
---------------------
    1. To create the server executable, type 'make' or 'make server' in the
    command-line.

    2. To create the server, dijkstra, or digraph object files, type 'make
    <object_file>.o' in the command-line, where <object_file> is server,
    dijkstra, or digraph.

    3. To remove all object files and executables, type 'make clean' in the
    command-line.

-----
Notes
-----
    * server.cpp contains the main program.

    * The program assumes that a command-line argument of the digraph .txt file
    is passed. I.e., after 'make graph_concepts', the user could type
    './graph_concepts edmonton-roads-2.0.1.txt'.

    * If an invalid graph file name is passed to readGraph(), the program will
    inform the user that there is no valid digraph text file provided, give the
    correct usage, and exit the program.

    * An example of a road network with 4 vertices and 3 edges is below (please
    see the assignment description for more details):

        V,1,53.430996,-113.491331
        V,2,53.434340,-113.490152
        V,3,53.414340,-113.470152
        V,4,53.435320,-113.480152
        E,1,3,St Albert Road
        E,2,3,80 Avenue North-west
        E,2,1,None

    * The Makefile will echo helpful messages to the user upon correct usage.
