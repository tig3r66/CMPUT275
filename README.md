# CMPUT 275 Final Projecct

## COURSE DESCRIPTION

CMPUT 274/275 is an experimental 2-course pilot introduction to computer science at the University of Alberta. It integrates the introductory computing courses (CMPUT 174/175) with the second-year introductory algorithms course (CMPUT 204) and the second year introductory systems course (CMPUT 201).

The course uses a problem-based approach to motivate the concepts and illustrate their application. It will be using the Arduino concrete-computing platform so that students will both become familiar with the typical screen-keyboard-mouse style of computing, but also the kind of embedded computing that is behind the scenes in the many devices that surround us. Delivery is hands on, with the classes taking place in the lab environment.

## Final Project: EEG Visualizer
In this application, we visualize live-time EEG data alongside a Fast Fourier Transform plot in an application run by PyQt5 and Matplotlib (data obtained from https://raphaelvallat.com/bandpower.html). The subject from which data has been obtained has high delta power as the signals were obtained during N3 sleep. Here, we implement the radix-2 decimation-in-time algorithm. This project is still under development. Here, students were permitted to create any type of project.
